    <p>This course is an introduction to web development using HTML and CSS and JavaScript.  The course will consist of lectures, in-class demonstrations, studio work, some weekly assignments and a final project.  We will explore the use of the Internet, multimedia and software as a platform for art and design.  Technical and conceptual inquiries will be combined in the production of web based work.</p>
