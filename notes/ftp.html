      <h2>Super quick FTP instructions</h2>
      <p><a href="http://helpdesk.pages.tcnj.edu/web-development/student-organization-web-development-faqs/">This page</a> explains how to setup up your student server.  It is kind of complicated, so I would start here and only look there if its not working.</p>
      <p>First thing, download <a href="http://cyberduck.en.softonic.com/mac" target="blank"> Cyberduck.</a></p>
      <p>When you open Cyberduck it will look like this.</p>
      <img src="../imgs/week1/cyberduck1.jpg" />
      <p>Click "Open Connection".</p>
      <p>A window will appear.  It should be set to FTP (File Transfer Protocol).  If not, change it using the first dropdown.</p>
      <img src="../imgs/week1/cyberduck1.5.jpg" />
      <p>In the server input, write: <pre>beauty.tcnj.edu</pre> Username is your tcnj username.  Mine is "robertso".</p>
      <p>Password is your email password.  Mine is justkidding12.</p>
      <p>Hit "Connect".</p>
      <p>You should see your root server folder! (If you don't, send me an email.)</p>
      <p>Create a folder called "www".  This is your public directory.  Anything that you put in here will be publicly available to anyone with an Internet connection.  Anything not in here will not be publicly viewable.</p>
      <p>Create an index.html page for this directory.  It could be a splash page with links to homework assignments, or anything you want to display.  Once you have an index page, you can view it by going to <pre>tcnj.edu/~[yourusername]</pre> in any browser. (Replace [yourusername] with your user name, meaning no brackets, just the characters in your username, to be very clear.)</p>
      <p>For this week's homework, you will create a folder called "week1" or something else descriptive of your project, and put all of your files in there.  This becomes the "root" folder for you project for this week.  When I go to the URL <pre>tcnj.edu/~[yourusername]/week1/</pre> I will find your homework.  I know this might be confusing at first.  Don't worry, you are not being graded on your ability to complete this tutorial.  You will become very familiar with FTP as the class progresses.</p>
      <p>When you are finished, your server should looks something like this:</p>
      <img src="../imgs/week1/cyberduck2.jpg" />
      <p><span class="note">Note:</span> Cyberduck is not automatically updated.  If you modify your files, add new files, or change your website in any way, those changes will not be reflected online unless you manually update your server using Cyberduck or another FTP program.  To do this, simply repeat the process detailed above, then drag your files into the same place.  Cyberduck will prompt you, asking if you want to "Overwrite" your files, to which you will say yes.</p>
      <p>Don't assume that your files have been correctly loaded unless you see them live on your server.</p>
      <p><span class="note">Note:</span> If you are not on TCNJ's campus, you will need to use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to connect to the server.  To do this, go to <a href="https://tcnjvpn.tcnj.edu/dana-na/auth/url_default/welcome.cgi">this url</a> and sign in with your email handle and password.  Once you have signed in (you may need to go through each step more than once as you try to connect) you will be able to use Cyberduck normally.  For further instructions, <a href="http://www.tcnj.edu/~nts/documents/Using%20the%20TCNJ%20VPN.pdf">look here</a>.  This site will not work in Chrome, you must use Safari or Firefox.</p>
