      <h1>Final</h1>
      
      <hr>
      
      <p>The final draft of your site is due next week.  Here are some guidelines for what you should have.</p>
      
      
      <style type="text/css">
      ul.final li {padding-bottom:10px;}
      </style>
      <ul class="final">
        <li>Final blogpost describing design and functionality decisions, difficulties that you encountered, and how you feel about the final product.  Include images of the site in various states of progress.  Talk about what you learned and what was challenging.</li>
        <li>Your site should be on your server and all images, links and pages should work.  I should be able to find your site by clicking through from your home/splash page.  If you prefer to host your site as the main page on your server, which would make sense if you want to send it out for job applications, etc, make the switch after the final.</li>
        <li>There should not be excess code.  This means, if you have borrowed code from my examples or other resources online, there should not be extra lines that are not being used or just commented out.  This means HTML, CSS and JavaScript files should not have any unused lines.</li>
        <li>Code and markup should be commented.</li>
        <li>Navigation through the site should be clear.  I do not want to have to click the back button, or type anything in the URL bar to navigate your site.</li>
        <li>Images should be sized and compressed properly.</li>
        <li>Any functionality should be working smoothly.  If you have errors implementing JavaScript or CSS3 functionality, use an HTML fallback and we can fix the errors after the final.</li>
        <li>Everything should be done.  This should be obvious.  But if you have projects in your portfolio that are still being worked on, or information for your site that you are still writing, leave it out for now, and add it in later.  This should be a clean, finished product, that you would be happy to send to a potential client or whatever.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Can't wait to see your final projects!  Of course, email me if you have any questions before the final.</p>
