      <h2>Characteristics of Web 1.0</h2>
      
      <p>The terms Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 were coined in 1999, when development in dynamic web design and CSS led to a shift in design characterized as Web 2.0.  Web 1.0 had been concerned with hyperlinks and text, with some images, and was considered a "top down" approach to design, where content was not editable by users, instead, most web content was posted by "webmasters", developers and web authors.  Concerns about privacy and technological limitations were responsible for a mostly one way flow of information, or "read only" material.</p>
      <p>Web 1.0 used some design elements that are no longer considered the best practice for building web pages, including frames, tables, spacers, and <a href="http://www.complexify.com/buttons/" target="blank">animated gifs for buttons</a> and other image elements.</p>
