      <h1>Make a site with a two column layout</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>This week we are going to start making new sites.  If you want to continue developing your site from Week 1 and 2, I am happy to look at it and give you feedback.  But this week we are starting from scratch.  We're going to focus on layout so we need some info.  Choose a person to make a site about.  It could be a famous person like an actor, athlete, writer or just someone you know like your grandma.  Make a site with information about them and some images.  Your layout should have two columns, a header and a navigation menu, footer, or both.  Arrange the information and media about this person in a way that makes sense to the user.  You should have more than one page.</p>
      <p>If you can't think of someone to make a site about, let me suggest my favorite basketball player, <a href="http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/08/19/andre-drummond-learns-never-to-play-h-o-r-s-e-with-rasheed-wallace/" target="blank">Rasheed Wallace</a>, or the great poet <a href="http://www.yeatsvision.com/" target="blank">W. B. Yeats</a>.  There's a ton of information available online about both.</p>
