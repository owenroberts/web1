      <h1>Photoshop for the web</h1>
      <hr>
      
      <p>There are two parts to your assignment this week.  The first is to choose a well designed or well-known website and do a wireframe, with a hand drawn sketch and Photoshop elements layout.  The second is to create a wireframe for the 2 column sites we made last week.  On your blog, write about anything you learned about your original design through this process.</p>
