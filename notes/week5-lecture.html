      <p>Wireframing is the practice of creating visual guides or mockups of static designs before "coding" those designs.  This is a good process to use for collaborative projects, or for people who come from design backgrounds.</p>
      
      <p>There are many ways to start a wireframing process.  A good practice is to look at sites that have good designs and wireframe those designs.  A wireframe could just be a hand sketch on paper which is then converted to HTML/CSS.  Often the process will go from sketch to Photoshop/Illustrator and then to HTML/CSS.  This depends on the preference of the designer or team.</p>
      
      <p>For wireframing a new site design, start with a basic layout, like this 2 column layout we learned last week.</p>
      
      <div id="layouts">
        <img src="../imgs/week5/layout.jpg" />
      </div>
      
      <p>Next step is to create a grayed out layout with basic dimensions.</p>
      
      <div id="layouts">
        <img src="../imgs/week5/grey.jpg" />
      </div>
      
      <p>Then place specific elements onto the page.  When using Photoshop or Illustrator, your elements should be clearly labeled so you can remember what each element is for and share your layouts with collaborators.</p>
      
      <div id="layouts">
        <img src="../imgs/week5/elements.jpg" />
      </div>
      
      <p>Finally begin designing the visual elements themselves.</p>
      
      <div id="layouts">
        <img src="../imgs/week5/visual.jpg" />
      </div>
      
      <p>Now we'll go through the steps of turning this PSD into a HTML/CSS layout with styles.  This will be a review of last week in many ways, but will introduce this workflow and reiterate the concepts we've already learned.</p>
