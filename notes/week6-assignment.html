      <h1>New CSS layout</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>We're going to work on one more assignment using the designs from the <a href="week4-assignment.html">2 column layout assignment</a>.  Take the HTML pages from that assignment and copy them into a new folder for week 6.  Then makes new CSS style sheets from scratch.  Make a completely new layout using the same elements.  Your elements should be positioned in a new way.  You could use a fixed position element, swap the footer and the header, or any other variation you can think of.  Be creative and use the same content to make a completely new website.</p>
