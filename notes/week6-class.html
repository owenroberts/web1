      <h1>Wireframe swap</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>We're going to do an in class exercise today, a wireframe swap.</p>
      <p>Get a partner.  You are each going to make a wireframe for a site using content of your choice.  Make a wireframe for one page including a navigation menu, logo, layout and positioning for media.  You can do a drawing by hand or on Photoshop, Illustrator or any drawing program of your choice.  Start with one of the <a href="week4-lecture.html#lay_outs">basic layouts</a> we looked at in week 4.  Make a wireframe with elements, outlines and sizes.</p>
      <p>We'll use 30 minutes to make the wireframe.  Then exchange your wireframes with your partner.  The rest of the class will be dedicated to writing the markup to make the wireframes actual sites with HTML & CSS.  Makes notes about the issues you run into when converting the wireframe into markup.  Post the site you make on your server space and link to it from your splash page.  Post the wireframes on your blog.</p>
