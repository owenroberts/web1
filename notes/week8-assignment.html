      <h1>Final project proposal</h1>
      <hr>
      
      <p>Next week we will give presentations during the lecture section of class.  Each student should have a presentation prepared using a slideshow or powerpoint (or web based slide show) about the site you want to make as a final project over the next several weeks.  You should present the content, functionality and some preliminary design concepts.</p>
      <p>The presentation should include:</p>
      <ul><li>Overall pitch for site content.</li>
        <li>Overview of functionality: number of pages, types of interactions and menus, intended user experience.</li>
        <li>Media plan for images, video and text content.</li>
        <li>Site architecture diagram.</li>
        <li>Examples of inspiration sites.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <p>The presentations should be five to ten minutes, followed by five minutes of feedback.</p>
        
        <p>Don't forget to choose a website for the hallway screen.  Take some time to fix any errors and clean up the design.</p>
