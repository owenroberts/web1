      <h1>Web standards</h1>
      <hr>
      
      <p>Web standards are standards or web design and development that are documented by various groups, including the World Wide Web Consortium, which offer non-proprietary technical specifications for web sites.  These standards are the basis for best practices, a philosophy of web design that observes the standards.</p>
      
      <p>In common use, this means that a web site complies with valid HTML, CSS and JavaScript coding.  It also includes semantic guidelines and accessibility standards.  There are various groups dedicated to updating standards for HTML and other markup languages, CSS and stylesheets and JavaScript and other scripting languages.</p>
      
      <p>In practical usage, the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/" target="blank">validator resource</a> provided by the W3C, is basically the best way to validate code and learn best practices through experience and trial and error.  Familiarizing oneself with web standards is a good way to learn to write efficient code that works.<a href="http://infohound.net/tidy/" target="blank">HTML Tidy</a> is another good resource.</p>
      
      <p>An example of a web standard is using the DOCTYPE declaration for the appropriate HTML standard.  We have been using HTML5, which is simply <code>&#60;!DOCTYPE html&#62;</code>.</p>
      
      <p>Another useful service is <a href="http://validator.w3.org/checklink" target="blank">Link Checker</a>.  Web standards dictate that links remain valid and that broken links are removed, though this is almost never the case, and a huge fraction of legal documents, government documents and other sources online are filled with broken links.</p>
      
      <p>Web standards dictate against the use of deprecated CSS tags like the FONT property or the FACE attribute.  It is considered <a href="http://alis.isoc.org/web_ml/html/fontface.en.html" target="blank">harmful</a>.</p>
