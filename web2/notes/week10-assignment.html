      <h1>Make prototype of JavaScript functionality</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>After doing wireframes and layouts for your projects, you should have a sense of what you will need the JavaScript to do in terms of functionality.  Make a working prototype of this functionality.  Don't worry too much about the style and content for this week.  Just make sure all of your JavaScript is working and any libraries you need are working correctly with your code.</p>
      <p>Your JavaScript should be in an external file unless it is very short or needs to be inside the HTML page for some reason.</p>
      <p>Use dummy content and some image or video place holders to represent how JavaScript will interact with the rest of the page.</p>
      <p>For some of you, the JavaScript will be relatively minimal for the final project.  If that's the case, start working on the HTML pages and adding styles as well.</p>
      <p>If you are making a more complex interaction like a game, you made need more than one week to finish a prototype.  Try to build some of the functionality and map out the rest as you go.</p>
