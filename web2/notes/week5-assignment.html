      <p>Using jQuery, create a website that uses objects and loops to populate a page with HTML and CSS.  It does not have to be a grid, but it should have multiples of an object modified to create a design.  Use the content from another page or create new content for this project, but work should be focused on design elements like form, composition and color.</p>
