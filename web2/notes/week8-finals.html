      <h1>Final concept presentations</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>Next week we are presenting ideas for the final.  Please prepare a presentation of around 5 minutes with visuals to describe the concept of a final that you would like to work on.  Include basic design elements, form, color, typography and the content that you want to work with.  Finals can be anything you are interested in creating as long as they include interactivity and design.  This could be a prototype for a website, game, data visualization or anything else you are interested in creating.  Give us an overview of the content, design concepts, and coding principles that will be required to execute the project, and a simple schedule of how you plan to work on it over the end of the semester.</p>
