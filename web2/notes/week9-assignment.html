      <h1>Final wireframes and project plan</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>Over the next few weeks we will do in class workshops on the final projects.  I will meet with each of you individually each week to look at progress and help with technical and conceptual questions.</p>
      <p>This week map out the elements of your project, documents, code, libraries, image assets and other content, and make a basic structure for completing each task over the end of the semester.  We will use that as an outline to complete the projects.</p>
      <p>Along with the project plan, make some visual wireframes that will layout the basic design for you project.  This can be done with HTML/CSS or in Photoshop/Illustrator, or another graphics program.  You should have dummy content in place of all of the image, text or video assets you plan to use, along with a defined format, color scheme, typographic scheme and page layout.  Have a few different iterations of your idea to look at next week.</p>
